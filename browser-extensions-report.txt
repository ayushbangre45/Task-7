Actions Taken

- Removed “AutoDraw for skribbl.io”
  - Reason: Not needed anymore, suspicious functionality (auto-playing), unverified developer.
- Kept all other extensions after verifying permissions and developer credibility.


What I Learned

- Extensions asking to “read and change all data on websites” should be reviewed carefully.
- Official extensions from Google or trusted developers are generally safe.
- Unverified tools or game cheats may pose privacy and security risks.
